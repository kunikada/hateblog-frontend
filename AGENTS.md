# Work Rules

To avoid additional effort caused by rework, follow the rules below.
All responses must be written in Japanese.

## Documents

- Keep the content to the bare minimum required.
- Keep each file to about 500 lines or fewer.
- If you believe samples or examples are necessary, ask before adding them.
- Separate summary text from any sample or example files.
- Confirm that you are writing in the correct file and not duplicating content.

## Coding and Editing

- Present your approach and gain approval before implementing or modifying anything.
- If you must do something different from the instructions, explain and get consent first.
- When changing configurations or policies, explain and obtain consent.
- If another issue is found while working, pause and confirm before proceeding.
- Ask questions whenever project-specific judgment is unclear.
- Delete any temporary files created during the work.
- Structure directories and files with their responsibilities in mind.
- When adding debug messages in JavaScript, use `console.debug`.

## Testing

- Create tests when necessary.
- Run the tests and verify the results.
- Killing a process may terminate the editor, so confirm beforehand.
